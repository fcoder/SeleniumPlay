The Folder for This Program as a Standalone App is ~/MyProjects/Python/SmallProg/SeleniumPlay
It is also in Chinesesong archive such user <root>tools/selenium

===============================
How to Run the Compiled Program
===============================
On Yuming MacBook Pro
  cd ~/MyProjects/Python/SmallProg/SeleniumPlay
  play <n>          to use www.chinesesong.net
  play_local <n>    Run "flask run --port=5001" to start localhost server first
  play and play_local are scripts under /usr/local/bin

================================
Make and Run On Susan Snapdragon
================================
  (1) cd C:\Users\User\Yuming\Selenium
  (2) venv\Script\activate
  (3) python selenium_dragon.py linode <n>
  (4) Or compile with
         pyinstaller --onefile selenium_dragon.py
  (5) The back file play.bat has been put in C:\Users\User\Yuming\Script
      which is in the Path system environment variable, so we can type play <n>
      from anywhere in the Snapdragon to run this app. (play.bat knows that the
      compiled selenium_dragon is under C:\Users\User\Yuming\Selenium\dist)
  (6) There is also a shortcut on the Snapdragon, double click to ran the play.bat
      in in C:\Users\User\Yuming\Script

================================
Make and Run on Yuming's MacBook
================================
  (1) cd ~/MyProjects/Python/SmallProg/Selenium
  (2) source venv/bin/activate
  (3) python3 selenium_mac.py linode <n>
  (4) Or compile with
         pyinstaller --onefile selenium_mac.py

Run Compiled Version:
  dist/selenium_dragon     linode <n>
  dist\selenium_dragon.exe linode <n>


Must Do The Following Before Running The Python Code
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install selenium 
  pip install pytube
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  pip install requests
  pip install lxml
  pip install isodate
  pip install pyinstaller     for compilation

If we run Chinesesong Flask server on my MacBook: flask run --port=5001

Enable "Allow Remote Automation" on Safari.
  Open Safari:
  Launch Safari on your MacBook Pro.
  Enable the Develop Menu:
  Go to Safari > Settings (or Preferences on older macOS versions).
  Click on the Advanced tab.
  Select Developer Settings...
  Check the box for "Show Develop menu in menu bar".
  Close and reopen Safari to ensure the setting takes effect if necessary

To compile (Must do pip install pyinstaller first):
  pyinstaller --onefile selenium_play.py 
  pyinstaller --onefile selenium_mac.py
  pyinstaller --onefile selenium_dragon.py
  pyinstaller --onefile selenium_wintel.py

To run on MacBook with Caffeinate so that the computer will not enter sleep mode. -i prevents idle sleep
Run source code  ??? = play, mac, dragon, wintel
  caffeinate -i python3 selenium_???.py linode|local <n>
                python3 selenium_???.py linode|local <n>
Run compiled executable
  caffeinate -i dist/selenium_??? linode|local <n>
                dist/selenium_??? linode|local <n>

=================================
Start From Shortcut And Run Batch
=================================
The shortcut 听歌学中文 will invoke the batch file play.bat under C:\Users\User\Yuming\Script, which
is included in the Path system environment variable. play.bat can be run as play with or without
a number for the videos to play. The shortcut will prompt a number

Prepare Safari for using Selenium
For Safari
Safari Browser:

Safari is pre-installed on macOS. Ensure you are using the latest version by checking for macOS updates.
Enable WebDriver for Safari:

Safari has a built-in WebDriver (SafariDriver). You need to enable it:
Open Safari > Preferences > Advanced.
Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar".
In the Develop menu, select "Allow Remote Automation".
No Additional Driver Needed:

SafariDriver comes bundled with Safari, so you don’t need to download anything extra.


Difference between MacOS/Safari and WinTel/Chrome:
  Detect Operating System:
  Uses platform.system() to determine whether the program is running on macOS or Windows.

  Initialize Correct WebDriver:
  Initializes Safari for macOS and Chrome for Windows with appropriate options.

  Cross-Platform Handling:
  Handles WebDriver differences within an if...elif...else structure.

  Unified Code:
  Shared logic for playing videos is the same for both operating systems.


===========================================
How To Get The Code Work On A WinTel System
===========================================
(1) Check if python is installed on WinTel with python --version
(2) May not see python unless the path is in the system environment variable
    Win-S to open and search for Environment Variables. Selet Path, press New to add the path to python into sys env variables
    Then I can see python --version from anywhere
(3) Use python -m ensurepip --default-pip to check if pip is installed
(4) Also add  C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\<PythonVersion>\Scripts\ to System Environment Variable
    Then I will be able to use  pip
(5) Do python -m venv venv to create a venv
(6) venv\Scripts\activate to activate (Diff from MacBook)
    deactivate
(7) Use pip install to install all the python packages listed at the beginning of this cmds
(8) In order to run selenium_play.py on a WinTel using Chrome, I need to install ChromeDriver
    In Chrome, type chrome://settings/help to see Chrome version
    On the WinTel, Use Chrome to visit https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ 
    Click Downloads in Navigation Bar
    Fond the match ChromeDriver version for my Chrome, copy the URL to download
    Unzip the ChromeDriver, it is on the following path, so set driver_path in selenium.py
    driver_path = r"C:\Users\swang\Downloads\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver.exe"
(9) Now just run selenium with python selenium.py linode <n>
(10) Also compiled with command pyinstaller --onefile selenium_play.py 

findstr is grep on WinTel 

==================================================================
Options for Using Selenium with Chrome on Windows with Snapdragon:
==================================================================
*** Use Chromium Edge (Microsoft Edge) Instead ***
Why This Works:
  Microsoft Edge, based on Chromium, has better support for Windows on ARM, and the
  EdgeDriver is fully compatible with ARM-based systems.
  Steps:
    1. Install Microsoft Edge for Windows on ARM: Download Edge.
    2. Download the matching version of EdgeDriver: Download EdgeDriver.
    3. Use Selenium with the following code snippet: 

      from selenium import webdriver
      from selenium.webdriver.edge.service import Service
      from selenium.webdriver.edge.options import Options

      edge_options = Options()
      edge_options.add_argument("--start-maximized")
      service = Service("path/to/msedgedriver")  # Path to the EdgeDriver executable

      driver = webdriver.Edge(service=service, options=edge_options)
      driver.get("https://www.google.com")
